            <h2>TIME TRIALS SAFETY RULES</h2>
            <div class="introduction">
            <p>We have adopted the rules of the Sports Car Club of America</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph"
            
            <p>Motorsports are inherently dangerous. These Rules are in no way a guarantee against injury or<br> 
                death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by driving well, properly using<br>
                superior safety gear, paying attention, and reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials.<br>
                Drivers are responsible for ensuring that the vehicle being used is properly prepared for operation<br>
                under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces. Drivers must have a Technical<br>
                Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available to present to an SCCA Official.<br></p>
            <p>Entrants are reminded that there is a considerable gap between a minimum standard and the best<br>
                protection that current technology can provide. It is recommended that seats, restraint systems,<br>
                roll bars and helmets meet the highest safety standards possible.<br></p>
            <p>National Time Trials Events and some SCCA Regions require more than the minimum safety<br>
                required by these Rules. In these cases, there are two additional Safety Levels.<br></p>

                    <li><b>Overview</b>
                    <p>Safety Level 2 generally means a 4-point roll bar, 5-point racing harness, arm restraints or window <br>net, and fire-retardant helmets and clothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>For Time Trials Nationals Events, vehicles running on DOT-approved tires with less than 200 <br>treadwear or beyond Max Category Rules must meet Safety Level 2 Standards. Vehicles with <br>modified or aftermarket fuel tanks and lines which run through the cockpit will need to meet Safety <br>Level 2 Standards for driver clothing.</p>
                    <p>All vehicles required to meet Safety Level 2 Standards must meet the Safety Level 1 Standards, plus <br>the additions below</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Vehicle Equipment</b>
                        <ol class="level-3">
                            <li><b>Roll Bars</b> <br>These specifications apply to all vehicles (other than those issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19). <br>Cars issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19 may continue to compete with their previously <br>approved rollover structure or comply with the following specifications.<br>
                            A roll bar is defined as a main hoop and diagonal placed behind the driver and supplemented by <br>two braces. The roll bar must be designed to withstand compression forces resulting from the <br>weight of the car coming down on the roll structure, and to take fore-and-aft loads resulting from <br>the car skidding along the ground on the roll structure. The basic purpose of the roll bar is to <br>protect the driver in case the vehicle rolls over. Roll bars must meet the following criteria:<br>
                            
                                <ol class="level-4">
                                    <li>One continuous length of tubing must be used for the hoop member with smooth continuous <br>bends and no evidence of crimping or wall failure.</li>
                                    <li>The top of the roll bar must be above the top of the driver’s helmet when the driver is in normal <br>driving position.</li>
                                    <li>The two (2) vertical members forming the sides of the hoop must be more than 15 inches apart <br>(inside dimension), and it is desirable that it extend the full width of the cockpit.</li>
                                    <li>An inspection hole of at least 3/16 inch diameter to facilitate verification of wall thickness may <br>be required. It must be drilled in a non-critical area of a roll bar member at least three inches from <br>any weld or bend.</li>
                                    <li>All bolts and nuts shall be SAE Grade 5 or better, 5/16-inch minimum diameter.</li>
                                    <li>Braces and portions of the main hoop subject to contact by the driver’s or passenger’s helmet, as <br>seated normally and restrained by seatbelt and harness, must be padded with a non-resilient <br>material such as Ethafoam® or Ensolite® or other similar material with a minimum thickness of 1/2 <br>inch. Padding meeting SFI spec 45.1 or FIA 8857-2001 is strongly recommended.</li>

The following minimum sizes are required and are based upon <br>the weight of the car without the driver. Dimensions are nominal; 0.010-inch variation in wall <br>thickness is allowed.<br>

                                    <li>The roll bar hoop and all braces must be of seamless or DOM mild steel tubing (SAE 1010, 1020, <br>1025) or equivalent, or alloy steel tubing (SAE 4130). For cars logbooked before 1/1/16, existing ERW <br>tubing is acceptable.</li>
                                    <li>All welding should be of the highest possible quality with full penetration. Craters should be filled <br>to the cross section of the weld and undercut be no more than 0.01 inch deep.</li>
                                    <li>All roll bars must be braced in a manner to prevent movement in a fore-and-aft direction with <br>the braces attached within the top third of the roll hoop. At a minimum, two (2) braces must be <br>used, parallel to the sides of the car, and placed at the outer extremities of the roll bar hoop. Such <br>braces should extend to the rear whenever possible. Diagonal lateral bracing must be installed to <br>prevent lateral distortion of the <br>hoop. In most cases, a lateral brace from the bottom corner of the hoop on the side to the top corner of the hoop on the other side is sufficient. Although installing the <br>diagonal lateral brace in the main hoop is the strongest alternative (and hence most preferable), <br>there may be instances where such an installation is not practical. In such situations, the <br>installation of the diagonal brace running from the bottom of the fore/aft brace on one side to the <br>top corner of the hoop on the other side is acceptable. In convertible vehicles with a production <br>line beginning 1990 or later, such as the Mazda Miata, a “V” design, also known as a “double <br>diagonal” used between the rear supports is acceptable.</li>
                                    <li>Removable roll bars and braces must be very carefully designed and constructed to be at least <br>as strong as a permanent installation. If one (1) tube fits inside another tube to facilitate removal, <br>the removable portion must fit tightly and must bottom on the permanent mounting, and at least <br>two (2) bolts must be used to secure each telescope section. The telescope section must be at <br>least eight inches in length. One (1) bolt is required if one (1) end is welded to the main hoop.</li>
                                    <li>Roll bars and braces must be attached to the frame of the car wherever possible. Mounting <br>plates may be used for this purpose where desired.</li>
                                    <li>In the case of cars with unitized or frameless construction, mounting plates may be used to <br>secure the roll bar structure to the car floor. The important consideration is that the load be <br>distributed over as large an area as possible. A backing plate of equal size and thickness must be <br>used on the opposite side of the panel with the plates through-bolted together.</li>
                                    <li>Mounting plates bolted to the structure shall not be less than 0.1875 inch thick and the use of a <br>back-up plate of equal size and thickness on the opposite side of the panel with the plates <br>through-bolted together is recommended. A minimum of three (3) bolts per plate is required for <br>bolted mounting plates</li>
                                    <li>Mounting plates welded to the structure shall not be less than 0.080 inch thick. Whenever <br>possible, the mounting plate should extend onto a vertical section of the structure, such as a door <br>pillar.</li>
